<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I had a Wordpress site, stopped using it, and wanted something simpler instead.</p>
<p>I've had a website for blogging, CV, and portfolio needs since 2005 or so. In late 2010, life went into high gear. I didn't have much time or need to work on my website, partly because LinkedIn and IMDB covered my CV needs. In addition, I became disenchanted with Wordpress over the years due to its many security issues and the various complexities inherent to a dynmaic website's design. Basically, it was overkill for what I needed. As a result, lookslikematt.com only got security updates and didn't see any content updates after early 2011. </p>
<p>Over the next few years, I ended up working with Git and several Python based web frameworks. I grew to enjoy what Git provides and what Flask and Bottle can do with very little code. I also started following the development of GitHub pages. At some point, I looked back at my website and knew I needed to make some changes. That eventually led me to settle on some combination of <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and a <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/">static website generator</a>. </p>
<p>During the last year, I've been using the Windows Subsystem for Linux in order to run "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows" and have been really enjoying it for quickly doing filesystem related tasks. Since it's still beta, I've been reluctant to try it out for any development work. </p>
<p>But it's 2017 now. Let's see what amd how quickly the combination of the WSL, GitHub Pages, and Pelican can get me what I'm after.</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installing WSL</h2>
<p>This was very simple for me as I was on a high enough build, have a fast internet connection, and had gone through the installation process before. Even if for a first time experience, I would still only expect it to take about 15 minutes.</p>
<h2>Create a New Repo on GitHub</h2>
<p>Also very simple. Naming convention for the new repo is: <code>$GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io</code>.</p>
<h2>Pelican</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Launch a Bash terminal typing the following in the Windows start up area and clicking on the resulting orange and white icon: <code>Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</code>. Note that to paste into the Bash shell, you'll need to use the right mouse button istead of ctrl+v or the middle mouse button.</p>
<p>In Bash, I like to use <code>tree</code> and <code>git</code> is essential:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install tree
sudo apt-get install git
</pre></div>


<p>WSL ships with Pyhon 2.7.6. You'll need to install pip: https://docs.python.org/2/installing/#install-pip-in-versions-of-python-prior-to-python-2-7-9. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install python-pip
</pre></div>


<p>I took the additional step of installing virtualenv and using a virtual environment:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install virtualenv
</pre></div>


<p>Create a new virtualenv to work in and enter it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$YOUR_GOT_REPO_ROOT_DIR</span>
virtualenv ./venv
<span class="nb">source</span> venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>


<h3>Pelican Quickstart</h3>
<p>Install Pelican and ghp-import. The Pelican command might look a little odd, but it gives you both Pelican and Markdown in one go:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> pip install pelican markdown
<span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> pip install ghp-import
</pre></div>


<p>At this point, it's a good idea to create a requirements.txt file, just in case some time passes and you need to rebuild your virtual env with the exact same versions of the libraries.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</pre></div>


<p>Let's also commit it before moving forward:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> git add -A
<span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Adds virtual env requirements file.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Follow quickstart:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> pelican-quickstart
&gt; Where <span class="k">do</span> you want to create your new web site? <span class="o">[</span>.<span class="o">]</span>
&gt; What will be the title of this web site? Matthew Kapfhammer
&gt; Who will be the author of this web site? Matthew Kapfhammer
&gt; What will be the default language of this web site? <span class="o">[</span>en<span class="o">]</span>
&gt; Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., http://example.com   <span class="o">(</span>Y/n<span class="o">)</span> n
&gt; Do you want to <span class="nb">enable</span> article pagination? <span class="o">(</span>Y/n<span class="o">)</span> y
&gt; How many articles per page <span class="k">do</span> you want? <span class="o">[</span>10<span class="o">]</span>
&gt; What is your <span class="nb">time</span> zone? <span class="o">[</span>Europe/Paris<span class="o">]</span> US/Pacific
&gt; Do you want to generate a Fabfile/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? <span class="o">(</span>Y/n<span class="o">)</span> y
&gt; Do you want an auto-reload <span class="p">&amp;</span> simpleHTTP script to assist with theme and site development? <span class="o">(</span>Y/n<span class="o">)</span> y
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using FTP? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using SSH? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using S3? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> y
&gt; Is this your personal page <span class="o">(</span>username.github.io<span class="o">)</span>? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> y
</pre></div>


<p>Generate content based on .md files in ./content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> pelican content
</pre></div>


<p>Open a new Bash terminal and start the dev server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$YOUR_GOT_REPO_ROOT_DIR</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> venv/bin/activate
<span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> ./develop_server.sh start
</pre></div>


<p>Check the site in browser at <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>. </p>
<p>Now that's it working, let's stop the server and commit again before updating. Note that GitHub's .gitignore file already ignored the venv dir and all the .pyc files. While we won't be commiting the output dir right now, we won't ignore it either since we'll want to add it when we deploy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> ./develop_server.sh stop
git add Makefile develop_server.sh fabfile.py pelicanconf.py publishconf.py
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Adds quickstart files.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Update with Basic User Content</h2>
<p>The <code>develop_server.sh</code> script auto-reloads while making changes, so let's turn that back on in order to get updates as we save our text files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>venv<span class="o">)</span> ./develop_server.sh stop
</pre></div>


<h3>Add the About Page</h3>
<p>This required adding sub-directories to content and modifying <code>pelicanconf.py</code> again to update the menu.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>├── content
│   ├── blog
│   └── pages
│       └── about.md
</pre></div>


<p>Add to <code>pelicanconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">DISPLAY_CATEGORIES_ON_MENU</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
<span class="n">DISPLAY_PAGES_ON_MENU</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
<span class="n">MENUITEMS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;About&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/about&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Blog&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Add the First Article</h3>
<p>I added another .md file under <code>./content/blog</code>. You can see an example of what to add <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html#create-an-article">in the quickstart</a>.</p>
<h3>Config: Automate Getting Year</h3>
<p>It's not necessary, but is helpful to let code handle populating the date by adding this to <code>pelicanconf.py</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">time</span>
<span class="n">COPYRIGHT_YEAR</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">time</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;%Y&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Review</h3>
<p>We have just enough going now to publish some blog articles, which was the intended goal. I plan on later doing a follow-up post on updating the theme, adding a few more pages, and then customizing the look, etc. But for now, we're good to commit and move on to deploying!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add content pelicanconf.py
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Adds basic user content.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Deploy New Site</h2>
<p>Again, very simple. You just <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/tips.html#user-pages">run a few commands and you're done</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py
ghp-import output -b master
git push origin master
</pre></div>


<h1>Notes</h1>
<h2>Warnings</h2>
<h3>Commit with Unix Style Line Endings</h3>
<p>If you decide to commit with git gui launched from the Windows Explorer at any point, you need to commit with unix style line endings. Otherwise when you eventually checkout or pull again, you'll get errors if you try to run any of the bash scripts.</p>
<h2>More Reading</h2>
<p>I highly recommend making some time to <a href="https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pelican/3.3.0/pelican.pdf">read the Pelican manual</a>. It's well written and easier to skim than the website.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>At the this point, I'm feeling pretty proud of myself for doing little to nothing. Most of my time was spent researching and comparing my options. </p>
<p>Github Pages makes hosting dead simple and updating quick.</p>
<p>It feels like the styling choices for the headings in the default theme make it difficult to skim. This is a problem for me. Looking forward to adding a new theme!</p>                </article>
